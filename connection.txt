Below are the pin connections for the components in your "Eemo" AI assistant speaker box using an ESP32.

1. OLED Display (I2C)

VCC → 3.3V (ESP32 pin)

GND → GND (ESP32 pin)

SCL → GPIO 22 (ESP32 pin) (I2C Clock)

SDA → GPIO 21 (ESP32 pin) (I2C Data)


2. RGB LED (4 Pins: Red, Green, Blue, GND)

Red Pin (R) → GPIO 25 (ESP32 pin)

Green Pin (G) → GPIO 26 (ESP32 pin)

Blue Pin (B) → GPIO 27 (ESP32 pin)

GND Pin → GND (ESP32 pin)


3. PAM8406 Amplifier

VCC (Power) → 5V (ESP32 pin)

GND (Ground) → GND (ESP32 pin)

IN+ (Input +) → Audio input (Could be connected to I2S output or microphone module depending on setup)

IN- (Input -) → GND (Ground or I2S input depending on design)

OUT+ (Output +) → Speaker (+)

OUT- (Output -) → Speaker (-)


4. 3W Speaker

Positive terminal (+) → OUT+ of PAM8406 (Amplifier output)

Negative terminal (-) → OUT- of PAM8406 (Amplifier output)


5. MAX4466 Microphone Module

VCC → 3.3V (ESP32 pin)

GND → GND (ESP32 pin)

OUT (Signal) → MIC_PIN (GPIO 34) (ESP32 pin, used for analog microphone input)


6. Buttons

Play/Pause Button (PIN 32)

Pin 32 → Digital input (with INPUT_PULLUP configuration)

Connect one leg of the button to GPIO 32 and the other leg to GND


Volume Up Button (PIN 33)

Pin 33 → Digital input (with INPUT_PULLUP configuration)

Connect one leg of the button to GPIO 33 and the other leg to GND


Volume Down Button (PIN 35)

Pin 35 → Digital input (with INPUT_PULLUP configuration)

Connect one leg of the button to GPIO 35 and the other leg to GND



7. Bluetooth Communication

For Bluetooth communication, you don't need specific physical connections, as it uses the ESP32's built-in Bluetooth functionality (ESP32 is equipped with Bluetooth, so there are no external pins for this).

8. I2S (for Audio Output)

For audio output via PAM8406 amplifier, we can use the ESP32’s I2S interface. In your code, the I2S pins are defined as follows:

I2S Data Out (I2S_DOUT) → GPIO 22 (ESP32 pin)

I2S Bit Clock (I2S_BCLK) → GPIO 23 (ESP32 pin)

I2S Left Right Clock (I2S_LRC) → GPIO 21 (ESP32 pin)


Summary of Pin Assignments:

These connections should ensure that the components interact correctly with the ESP32 and work as expected in the AI assistant speaker box project.
